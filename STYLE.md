# Coding Style Guidelines/Rules
1. All truthy defines should have a value of 0 or 1, not true or false, and not an empty definition. Thus we use #if DEFINE rather than stuff like #ifdef DEFINE for most of our preprocessor checks that we control. Checking if a macro is defined is allowed but not the primary way we do this logic
2. In Batch scripts we use :: syntax for comments, not REM, except when inside an if/else scope where :: does not work. Environment variables internal to a script will use %lowercase_syntax%
3. Keywords NOTE: and TODO: should be used with the expectation that they will be highlighted by the editor in any file they appear
4. All compilable units (.exe, .dll, .lib) shall adopt a "unity build" approach where a single main.c can be compiled and it will #include all other source code it needs from there
5. We shall adhere to warning level 4 on MSVC compiler except for a designated set of warnings we don't care about, specified in build.bat. All warnings will be treated as errors and therefore must be fixed before checkin
6. All source files should have a header that clearly states the name of the file, creation date, author, and optionally a description of what the file contains. Script files like .bat and .py are excluded from this requirement.
7. All source files and folders containing them should be strictly lowercase with no spaces to make multi-platform path handling in build scripts and preprocessor easier
