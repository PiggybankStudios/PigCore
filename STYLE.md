# Coding Style Guidelines/Rules
1. All truthy defines should have a value of 0 or 1, not true or false, and not an empty definition. Thus we use #if DEFINE rather than stuff like #ifdef DEFINE for most of our preprocessor checks that we control. Checking if a macro is defined is allowed but not the primary way we do this logic
2. In Batch scripts we use :: syntax for comments, not REM, except when inside an if/else scope where :: does not work. Environment variables internal to a script will use %lowercase_syntax%
3. Keywords NOTE: and TODO: should be used with the expectation that they will be highlighted by the editor in any file they appear
4. All compilable units (.exe, .dll, .lib) shall adopt a "unity build" approach where a single main.c can be compiled and it will #include all other source code it needs from there
5. We shall adhere to warning level 4 on MSVC compiler except for a designated set of warnings we don't care about, specified in build.bat. All warnings will be treated as errors and therefore must be fixed before checkin
6. All source files should have a header that clearly states the name of the file, creation date, author, and optionally a description of what the file contains. Script files like .bat and .py are excluded from this requirement.
7. All source files and folders containing them should be strictly lowercase with no spaces to make multi-platform path handling in build scripts and preprocessor easier
8. ixx and uxx types will be used in the most core layers of the hierarchy so we can support building things for 32-bit platforms like Playdate and WebAssembly, but these can be assumed to be 64-bit types in the upper layers that are not planned to be used outside the desktop computing environment. rxx may be used in certain scenarios where it makes sense to use doubles only if on a 64-bit target but generally using r32 for most scenarios and only r64 when truly needed (regardless of perf) is the appropriate approach for floating point types.
9. We use the shortened words Pntr (for pointer) Ex (for extended) Iter (for iterator) Str (for string) Nt (for null-terminated), Def (for definition). Type suffixes may also be used for function names where overloads would be used in C++ (or where having the type be clear is important, like math incidental functions from stdlib), for example R32, I32, I8, etc.
10. All header files will include all the dependencies they rely upon explicitly, rather than implicitly relying on a required header for one of it's requirements. Unless the file actually uses nothing from the secondary include directly, then it can omit the include in the hopes that if the thing it actually depends upon eventually removes that dependency the file won't have an unnecassary include for something it really doesn't need. Any compilable .c file must include all it's dependencies, other .c files generally do not, they are generally ordered by some parent .c file that explicitly states the order of compilation. Some header files may wrap a collection of other header files to make it easy to include a whole bunch of header files. These can be included instead of the entire list of dependencies, but for core files that may be reused in various contexts this is discouraged. This is mostly for compilation unit authors that don't care too much about minimizing dependencies and just want to bring in a whole swatch of functionality easily.
11. File names are generally prefixed with the name of the folder they reside in. This may seem a little redundant but it makes it easier to talk about and search for them in a unique way.
12. Structures, enumerations, unions, and complex typedefs should adopt the lowercase_with_underscores naming pattern with suffixes to denote their type: \_s, \_e, \_u, \_t. Enumeration values should have the same name as their enumeration type but they drop the \_e suffix and replace with the name for each value. If an enumeration uses the last value as a count it should have the suffix \_count. If the enumeration has an invalid value it should be the first one, it should have a value of 0, and it should have the suffix \_none.
