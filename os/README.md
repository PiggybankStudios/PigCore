# os Folder
This folder contains all the files that help us interact with platform-specific features and libraries. Almost everything in the other folders should be platform agnostic and only rely on platform-specific features through abstractions made in this folder (or by #if guarding using defines provided by this folder). The abstraction does not have to be complicated if all the supported platforms are similar enough, it may even just be an alias for a function that is only available on a single platform. The purpose is to funnel all platform dependence through a single location so we can monitor and manage which parts of our codebase are dependent on platform specific functionality.
