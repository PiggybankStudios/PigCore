Description:
	** Contains functions that operate on the FilePath type (an alias of Str8) in
	** a cross-platform manner (handling forward and backslashes and sometimes
	** syntax like . and ..).
	** This file also contains functions that help us check where our executable
	** is located and where we are running from (the current working directory)
