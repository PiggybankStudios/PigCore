# \_scripts Folder
This folder contains scripts that are NOT in C. These are the only exception to the rules stated in the README.md about this codebase being in C23 and compilable on many devices. Currently this folder only contains a few python scripts that we use from inside the build.bat to accomplish a few tasks that would be annoying (or impossible) to do in batch, and would be annoying to write a full C-based executable to perform. As time goes on, and we have a continued need for particular scripts, we may look at converting them to C programs to restore the pure-C-ness of this repository.
