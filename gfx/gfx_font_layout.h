Description:
	** This file acts as the API for using the Font structure that
	** is defined in gfx_font.h to layout rastered glyphs from the
	** atlases in the font based on information that was extracted
	** from the ttf for how place each glyph relative to the one before.
	** NOTE: This layout code is relatively straightforward but it
	** needs to serve
